# Project details
Taking #100Dev courses. This is class 4 where we learned basic CSS. Instructed not to use classes or ids. Given a simple png and had to create the image only using tags. Had to manipulate different children with in tags.
# Learning
I learned about using different parents, children, and siblings. I was instructed not to use classes or ids and had to make the program as close to the the png. The colors might be a bit off and I used only web fonts so I did not have to import fonts. Learned about the siblings with '+', how to get the direct child with '>' or how to get a child with siblings.
